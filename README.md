# End to End House price prediction

Purpose of these project is to understand how a data science project lifecycle works.

## Dataset details: 

There are 14 features and 506 rows. 

Features are the following:
crim	zn	indus	chas	nox	rm	age	dis	rad	tax	ptratio	b	lstat	medv

Medv corresponds to the price

## Project step:
1. We first understand the dataset.
2. We find relation between columns using correlation matrix.
3. We develop a model which can predict the house price.
4. We deploy the model using pkl files.
